# CSE challenge

# Submission description:
# A visually appealing website where kids can learn cybersecurity tips.

# This was our first hackathon, and while we didn't complete the website, it was a valuable experience. 
# If we ever decide to participate in another one, we will have a better idea on what to expect and the challenges we will face during a hackathon.
